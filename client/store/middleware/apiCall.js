If we're here, THUNK has called an action creator that created an 
API action. I believe middleware are functions that redux automatically
runs under the hood passing certain parameters via currying. These are run
after an action is dispatched and before reducers are called. Each middleware
NEEDS three parameters, the a synthetic store obj (with dispatch and getstate methods),
the next middle/reducer to be called, AND the action that was dispached
